# Scraper

This is a simple scraper I made in python designed to go through all of the links of a website and scrape the emails

## Features

- Scrape sublinks of a website
- **Fast operation**: around 100 links in under a minute
- **Depth Selector**: Allows users to select different depths of how many layers down it should go.
- **Anti Wander**: Sticks to links only containing the main url
- **Redirection check**: Checks if a link is a redirection of an already visited link.

## Todo
- [ ] Add multithreading
- [ ] Add the option for headerless browsing
- [ ] Add a console menu to allow easier selection of options / switching between different modes
